# Python Project

A small Python project containing a main entry script and supporting modules. Use this README to set up the environment and run the app locally.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+

## Getting Started
1. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
   - Windows (PowerShell):
     ```bash
     python -m venv .venv
     .venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1
     ```
2. Install dependencies
   - This project currently has no external dependencies. If you add any, create a `requirements.txt` and install with:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
3. Run the program
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Project Structure
```

├─ main.py        # Entry point
├─ L2.py          # Module
├─ L3.py          # Module
├─ L4.py          # Module
└─ __pycache__/   # Bytecode cache (generated)
```

## Configuration
- No configuration is required by default. If your scripts rely on environment variables or config files, document them here.

## Testing
- If you add tests, place them in a `tests/` directory and run with `pytest`:
  ```bash
  pip install pytest
  pytest -q
  ```

## Notes
- Keep functions well-documented with docstrings.
- Prefer descriptive variable and function names.
- Run `python -m pip install --upgrade pip` occasionally to keep pip up to date.
